# PyScript documentation

Welcome to the PyScript documentation directory, where PyScript
is and related topics are discussed.

## Getting started

Before you start contributing to the documentation, it's worthwhile to
take a look at the general contributing guidelines for the PyScript project.

### Setup

The `docs` directory in the pyscript repository contains
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation project, which is a system
to take a plaintext files containing the documentation written in Markdown
and static files such as templates and themes to build the static end result.
